				An NYC health department program gives SNAP users an extra $10 if they buy fruits and vegetables at farmers markets, but how far does that extra money go?

			<p class="intro">Bronx, New York––Esther Neri is a regular at Lincoln Hospital Greenmarket in the South Bronx because the farmers’ market takes her EBT card loaded with SNAP benefits. By using her EBT card, she receives extra $2 coupons, called Health Bucks, to spend on fruits and vegetables at New York City farmers’ markets. The mother of three said this helps a lot, and it’s convenient since she lives within walking distance.
			</p>
			<p>“I like to buy vegetables more than anything, for the kids, and it helps, but there are people who don't know about these tickets, and they can use them here,” Neri said. 
			</p>
			<p>For every $2 spent at a designated <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/cdp/nyc-farmers-markets.pdf" target="_blank">NYC farmers’ market</a> using SNAP on an EBT card, one receives $2 on site in Health Bucks. Then, those pink and green coupons can be spent at any NYC farmers’ market on fruits and vegetables and don’t expire until the end of the year. The maximum amount one gets in Health Bucks each day is $10, which adds up if used daily. In total, there are 138 farmers’ markets across New York City that accept EBT and offer Health Bucks. 
			</p>
			<p>SNAP provides food assistance for low-income New Yorkers, which means finding quality fresh but reasonably priced fruits and vegetables is important. An <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9104456/" target="_blank">evaluation</a> of a fruit and vegetable incentive program for SNAP participants in California found the difference in median price overall for fruits and vegetables between farmers’ markets and supermarkets was not statistically significant, regardless if the items were organic or non-organic.
			</p>
			<p> To get an idea of how far $10 goes locally, the Mott Haven Herald compared prices for non-organic onions, apples, and broccoli around Lincoln Hospital. The four locations include the farmers’ market Lincoln Hospital Greenmarket (specifically from The Grandpa Farm in Chester, N.Y.), a street vendor on that same block, green grocer K&L Fruit and Vegetable around the corner, and Food Bazaar Supermarket less than a mile away.
